GOAL:

The system could be run in BOT mode to print on the screen all player's moves (with a 2 seconds timeout between each round) until someone won or the game ends with a draw.

Criteria:

• The Kata has to be done in solo mode
• Every scenario has to be planned in a pomodoro cycle
• The pomodoro cycle has to be committed with a ‘pair-programming-notes’ into the code base
• The notes have to show your simple design approach and how you organised the code growth between features VS tech debt and refactor
• The code has to be done in a strict TDD way, via cycles of Red/Green/Refactor with a commit, or more, for every cycle.
• The code has to be in a public code repository
• The refactor on this belt graduation will only focus on these aspects:
    1. Test: make the suite readable like the kata description
    2. Naming: the code and the tests have to share the same glossary/vocabulary
    3. Readability: the code has to be read as a book (hide the complexity behind behavioural encapsulation)

Extra evaluation points:

• Analyze the kata with an agile approach: product backlog, epics and smaller user story with UAT for the TDD approach;
• Create the UAT compliant with a BDD framework;
• Publish the project into an open source repository;
• Create the CI and CD pipeline;
• Publish the code coverage;
• Delivery the project with an application container;
• Design the project with a modern CQRS, event sourcing approach;
